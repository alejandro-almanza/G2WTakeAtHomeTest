This is an average small Spring Boot App. 

To build it you just need to perform a maven clean install, and it's executed as a 
Spring Boot App that starts the usual Tomcat server using the default port (8080).
An example to call the GET endpoint for getting the shortest route between to airports would be:

http://localhost:8080/takehometest/shortestroute?origin=YYZ&destination=YVR

where as you can imagine origin is the origin airport and destination, well... the destination. 
It responds with a JSON that contains an array of airports that would describe the shortest route
between the given to airports.
